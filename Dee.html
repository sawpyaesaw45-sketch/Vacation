        <p>Dee Doke Waterfall is located southeast of Mandalay City, near the Mytinge River. 
It's about 24 miles (38.6 km) from Mandalay, on the road towards Pyin Oo Lwin.
It has a depth of around 2 meters (6.5 feet). This makes it suitable for swimming but not for cliff jumping.
The waterfall area includes a main pool is known for its unique tree growing
out of the water, a higher pool, and several small huts where food and drinks are sold.
The best time to visit Dee Doke Waterfall in Mandalay, Myanmar, is during the dry season, which runs from October to May.
